# PersonalProjects
This is a collection of personal projects. Most of these were projects I assigned to the high school computer science course I taught in 2017-2018. I borrowed project ideas and starter files from a variety of sources, some of which came from Stanford's Nifty assignment collection (http://nifty.stanford.edu/) or from Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne, and Robert Dondero's book, Introduction to Programming in Python (https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/home/).

There are several dependencies, namely several packages written by the Intro to Programming team for their book (stdio and stddraw being the most important).

Here is a list of the projects in this repository with a brief description:

- blackjack.py
-- requires cards folder
-- using TKinter and inspiration from a project in Java, this program draws a blackjack table and allows the user to play blackjack against a simple AI

- mountain_paths.py
-- requires stddraw and stdio python package
-- inspired by a project from Stanford's Nifty assignments, this program takes elevation data of the Colorado mountains and implements a greedy pathfinding algorithm across the entire first column of the map, drawing both the map and all "shortest" paths

- universe.py
-- requires stddraw and stdio python package
-- requires vector.py and body.py
-- inspired by an Intro to Programming project and with data and files supplied by their team, this program simulates and animates gravity on any scale (from atoms to stars), with several starter scenarios to play with

- bouncing_ball.py
-- requires stddraw python package
-- this program simulates a ball bouncing around inside of a 2D box

- brownian_island.py
-- requires stddraw python package
-- this program draws an "island" using Brownian motion

- ifs.py
-- requires stddraw python package
-- this program generates fractals using an iterated function system; it currently generates a Sierpinski triangle, but it can generate many kinds of fractals with the right starting and choosing conditions

- sin_wave.py
-- requires stddraw python package
-- this program draws a simple function

- sorting_algorithms.py
-- several classic sorting algorithms

- sticks_game.py
-- this program generates a rudimentary AI for a very simple game and allows the user to play against it; the AI learns the optimal strategy for the game in a relatively small number of practice games

- turtle.py
-- requires stddraw python package
-- classic turtle graphics

- visual_sorting.py
-- requires stddraw python package
-- animates the comparisons of several different sorting algorithms
